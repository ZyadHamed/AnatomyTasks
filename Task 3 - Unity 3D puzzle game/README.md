# 3D Anatomy Organs Puzzle: Skeletal Arm

This project is a 3D puzzle game focused on the **Skeletal Arm**. The game allows users to interact with a 3D model of the skeletal arm, which is divided into 5 to 8 parts. The user can flip, rotate, and assemble the parts to reconstruct the complete organ. The game is developed using **Unity** for 3D game development and **Blender** for 3D modeling.

## Features

### 1. **3D Organ Model**
- **Skeletal Arm**: A detailed 3D surface model of the skeletal arm.
- **Division into Parts**: The organ is divided into 5 to 8 parts, either by sub-components (e.g., humerus, radius, ulna) or geometrical cuts.
  
### 2. **Puzzle Gameplay**
- **Randomization**: The parts are randomized in 3D location and orientation at the start of the game.

- **User Interaction**:
  - **Flip and Rotate**: Use keyboard shortcuts to flip and rotate each part in 3D space.
  - **Assemble**: Manually drag and align the parts to reconstruct the complete skeletal arm.
