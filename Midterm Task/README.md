# ACBI: Attenuation Coefficients-Based Imaging

This project presents a novel medical imaging technique developed by modifying the traditional attenuation law to achieve high-contrast imaging using near-infrared (NIR) light. This approach offers a safer and cheaper alternative to conventional imaging methods, such as CT scans and X-rays.

## Overview

### Introduction
In the human body, tissues have unique **absorption coefficients (µa)** and **scattering coefficients (µs)**, which determine how they interact with light. By leveraging these coefficients, the ACBI technique creates detailed, high-contrast images. This project modifies the attenuation law to account for parameters like light angle and distance, enabling precise computation of these coefficients.

### Breaking the Law: Modified Attenuation Formula
The classical attenuation law:
```
I = I₀e^(-z(µa + µs))
```
has been modified to:
```
I = I₀e^(-z(cos²(θ)µa + (L/L₀)µs))
```
where:
- **θ**: Angle of the light source relative to its propagation direction.
- **L**: Distance between the light source and the target.
- **L₀**: Standard distance (1 meter).

This modification allows fine control over attenuation, facilitating precise imaging without the need for high-energy radiation.

## How It Works

1. **Device Setup**:
   - The system comprises a bed with light detectors and an emitter containing NIR light sources.
   - The patient lies on the bed while the emitter rotates and adjusts its distance to collect attenuation data.

2. **Data Collection**:
   - Multiple beams are emitted through the target tissue slice.
   - The light’s intensity is measured after attenuation through various tissues.

3. **Mathematical Modeling**:
   - By solving equations derived from the modified attenuation law, the absorption and scattering coefficients for each tissue are determined.
   - This generates a high-contrast map of tissue properties, enabling detailed imaging.

4. **High-Resolution Imaging**:
   - The coefficients are mapped across (x, y, z) coordinates in the body to distinguish between high-scattering regions (e.g., bones) and high-absorption regions (e.g., soft tissues).

### Key Features
- **Radiation-Free**: Utilizes NIR light instead of high-energy radiation, ensuring patient safety.
- **Cost-Effective**: Eliminates the need for expensive components like superconductors or rapid rotation mechanisms.
- **High Contrast**: Provides clear differentiation between tissue types.
- **Flexible Parameters**: Adjustable θ and L allow for versatile imaging setups.

## Example Workflow
1. A beam of light with intensity \(I₀\) enters the tissue.
2. For each layer, the new intensity is calculated using the modified formula.
3. Multiple independent equations are generated by varying parameters \(θ\) and \(L\), enabling precise computation of \(µa\) and \(µs\).
4. High-resolution images are reconstructed from the computed coefficients.

## Advantages Over Traditional Techniques
- **Safety**: Unlike CT scans or X-rays, NIR imaging poses no radiation risks.
- **Affordability**: The absence of expensive components reduces operational costs.
- **Accessibility**: The simpler design makes this technology scalable and deployable in diverse medical settings.
